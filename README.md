[Lap Counter](https://wmolineros.github.io/Horror-movie-autogenerator/)
by Wanda Molineros

<p>This page enables a runner or their teammate to track the amount of laps they have ran. When I was in track and field I had to count the amount of laps that I ran in comparison to the rest of my team. During this time, I found it difficult to keep track of this information while running and would inevitably count wrong. 

In the future, I hope to further develop this page to include spreadsheet area where all the results are recorded for each username that has been inputted and find a way to evaluate the overall ranking as users compete.</p>

### Backend overview and tools
<p>Javascript, HTML and CSS are the front end codes used to build this page. Additional tools included the following:</p>

- [W3 Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea)
- [Github](https://github.com/): Code version control
- [Python Tutor: Javascript](https://pythontutor.com/render.html#mode=edit)
- [Code Beautify](https://codebeautify.org/jsvalidate)
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

### Game Logic
<p> As the user enters, they will find the 'home button' and 'rules of the game' to the left and right hand side respectively. The 'begin game' button will be in the center of the page to begin the quiz. The user can begin the quiz as they wish or read the rules of the game. The rules essentially state that the user has an option between 4 of the selections and one correct one must be selected to acquire a point. In the end, the user's time and score is recorded and the highest scores generated. </p>

### Credits 
<p>As previously stated, when I began working on the project I was going to do an autogenerator that would allow the user to make a selection of criteria that would essentially allow them to generate a horror movie that would be suited to them. I was unable to find any examples of this type of code making it very difficult for me to figure out. So I adopted a general approach of the horror trivia quiz and one example that really helped me on this journey was the [German Idiom Quiz](https://dragon-fire-fly.github.io/german-idiom-quiz). 

The German Idiom Quiz helped me generate and understand the code by adding funcitons, links to the DOM, form creation and calculation and local storage of high scores. I hope to take the knowledge that I've gained from this website in order to adopt my initial idea in the future. </p>

## Testing and errors identified
