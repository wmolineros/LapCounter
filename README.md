[Lap Counter](https://wmolineros.github.io/Horror-movie-autogenerator/)
by Wanda Molineros

<p>This page enables a runner or their teammate to track the amount of laps ran. When I was in track and field I had to count the amount of laps that I ran in comparison to the rest of my team. During this time, I found it difficult to keep track of this information while running and would inevitably count wrong. 

This javascript project held a lot of challenges for me both technically and personally. Initially, my idea consisted of the user entering the space, inputting their information and recording the outcome in such a way that each competitor would be ranked amongst each other. I managed to get as far as the form, lap count area and the countdown timer. As I was developing the idea, I found it difficult to generate my javascrip code during short spurts while caring for my son. This led to a lot of interrupted code concepts. On the technical end, I found that my code was not saving my changes in real time when I did get the chance to work on the project. Despite these challenges, I was able to create a form that led to an area that enabled the user to count the amount of laps during a 60 second period. In the future, I hope to further develop this page to include spreadsheet area where all the results are recorded for each username that has been inputted and find a way to evaluate the overall ranking as users compete. </p>

### Backend overview and tools
<p>Javascript, HTML and CSS are the front end codes used to build this page. Additional tools included the following:</p>

- [W3 Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea)
- [Github](https://github.com/): Code version control
- [Python Tutor: Javascript](https://pythontutor.com/render.html#mode=edit)
- [Code Beautify](https://codebeautify.org/jsvalidate)
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

### Overview of the site: Contents
<p> As the user enters, they will find a form in which they must input their username and meters. The user must input a field in each box before they're able to submit the form. Once the details have been added, the user can submit the form and begin running. The page then takes you to the lap counting area where the countdown timer automatically begins from 60 seconds. The user is to begin running and their teammate is able to count the amount of laps ran. </p>
